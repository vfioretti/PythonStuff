#1. Boost and Python installation directory

If Boost and Python are installed on Macports, these are the (probable) location directories you should use:
PYTHON_INCLUDE = /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)
PYTHON_LIB = /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)/config/
 
# location of the Boost Python include files and library
BOOST_INC = /opt/local/include/boost/python
BOOST_LIB = /opt/local/lib

# Boost Python library keyword (for Macports Boost installation use -lboost_python-mt)
BOOST_PYTHON_LIB = -lboost_python-mt

#2. Environment variables
